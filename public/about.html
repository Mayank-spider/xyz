<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Mayank Lakhchaura, a passionate Web Developer and Tech Enthusiast with a strong interest in cybersecurity, AI, and software development. I enjoy building interactive, user-focused websites and experimenting with modern web technologies to create clean and efficient digital experiences.</p>

<p>My journey started with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and soon expanded into hands-on projects — from developing responsive websites to working on object detection systems using YOLO and RCNN. I’ve also built an FPV drone from scratch, which strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of hardware–software integration.</p>

<p>Alongside web development, I’m exploring cybersecurity concepts through “The Complete Cyber Security Course: Hackers Exposed,” helping me develop a sharper, security-first mindset in all my projects.</p>
<p>I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and innovate — whether it’s developing web apps, securing digital platforms, or exploring new technologies that shape the future of the web.</p>
